<h1>CLIENT AND SERVER</h1>
<img src="https://webtask.io/images/docs/client-server2.png" height="500" width="900"></img>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Client: When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. 
Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).
<br><br>
Servers: Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something. 
Similarly in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.

<h1>COMPONENTS OF WEB APPLICATION</h1>
<img src="https://hackr.io/blog/web-application-architecture-definition-models-types-and-more/thumbnail/large" height="500" width="500"></img>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<br><br>
Any web application, big or small, contains these major components:<br>

View Layer:- When you consider an MVC application, the View layer component gives an interface to the application. 
Regardless if it is for users with a browser or for another application using Web services. View layer is the bridge for getting the data in and out of the application.<br><br>

It does not have business logic, like calculating interest for a banking application or storing items in a shopping cart for an online catalog. 
It also does not contain any code for existing data to or retrieving data from a data source. Business logic is managed by the Model layer. 
View layer is more focused on the interface.<br><br>

Business Layer:- It is also known as Business Logic or Domain Logic or Application Layer. 
The function of the business layer is to accept user requests from the browser, processes them, and determine the routes through which the data will be accessed. 
The workflows by which the data and requests travel through the back end lay encoded in a business layer.<br><br>

Data Access Layer:- This layer is built to keep the code you use to pull data from your data store like database, flat files, or web services separate from business logic and presentation code.
So even if you have to change data stores, you don’t end up rewriting the whole thing.

<h1>TYPES OF WEB CONTENT</h1>
<img src="http://www.webpagefx.com/img/web-content.jpg" height="500" width="500"></img>
<br><br>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. 
It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.

<h1>HTTP-HTTP REQUEST</h1>
<img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kereshmeh_Afsari/publication/311571526/figure/download/fig3/AS:438170157359106@1481479314691/HTTP-request-response-model.png"</img>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is invented by Tim Berner. HyperText is the type of text which is specially coded with the help of some standard coding language called as HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
HTTP/2 is latest version of HTTP, which was published on May 2015.
The protocols that are used to transfer hypertext between two computers is known as HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP provides standard between a web browser and web server to establish communication.
It is set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on the World Wide Web.
 Whenever a web user opens their web browser, user will indirectly uses HTTP. It is an application protocol which is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.<br>
<br>How it works ?<br><br>
First of all, whenever we want to open any website then first we open web browser after that we will type URL of that website (e.g., www.facebook.com ). 
This URL is now sent to Domain Name Server (DNS). Then DNS first check records for this URL in their database, then DNS will return IP address to web browser corresponding to this URL.
Now browser is able to sent request to actual server. After server sends data to client, connection will be closed. 
If we want something else from server we should have to re-establish connection between client and server.

<h1>WEB DYNAMIC PAGES</h1>
<img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.U_j8iwJzbzpOCOheJvVlMAHaCN&pid=Api&P=0&w=617&h=185"></img>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Dynamic Web Pages are written in languages such as CGI, AJAX, ASP, ASP.NET, etc. In dynamic web pages, the Content of pages is different for different visitors. It takes more time to load than the static web page.
Dynamic web pages are used where the information is changed frequently, for example, stock prices, weather information, etc.

<h1>APPLICATION SERVERS</h1>
<img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/What-is-Application-Server-1.jpg"></img>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
An application server is a server that hosts applications.
Application server frameworks are software frameworks for building application servers. 
An application server framework provides both facilities to create web applications and a server environment to run them.
An application server framework contains a comprehensive service layer model. 
It includes a set of components accessible to the software developer through a standard API defined for the platform itself.
For Web applications, these components usually run in the same environment as their web server(s), and their main job is to support the construction of dynamic pages.
However, many application servers do more than generate web pages: they implement services such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing, so developers can focus on implementing the business logic.

<h1>WEB SECURITY</h1>
<img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wr-85XxUVVY/TuaJFfT9CyI/AAAAAAAAAMo/Afviqfe2JWQ/s1600/web-security.jpg" height="500" width="700"></img>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Web security is also known as “Cybersecurity”. It basically means protecting a website or web application by detecting, preventing and responding to cyber threats.<br>
Websites and web applications are just as prone to security breaches as physical homes, stores, and government locations. Unfortunately, cybercrime happens every day, and great web security measures are needed to protect websites and web applications from becoming compromised.
That’s exactly what web security does – it is a system of protection measures and protocols that can protect your website or web application from being hacked or entered by unauthorized personnel.
This integral division of Information Security is vital to the protection of websites, web applications, and web services. Anything that is applied over the Internet should have some form of web security to protect it.
There are a lot of factors that go into web security and web protection. Any website or application that is secure is surely backed by different types of checkpoints and techniques for keeping it safe.
There are a variety of security standards that must be followed at all times, and these standards are implemented and highlighted by the OWASP. 
Most experienced web developers from top cybersecurity companies will follow the standards of the OWASP as well as keep a close eye on the Web Hacking Incident Database to see when, how, and why different people are hacking different websites and services.
Essential steps in protecting web apps from attacks include applying up-to-date encryption, setting proper authentication, continuously patching discovered vulnerabilities, avoiding data theft by having secure software development practices. 
The reality is that clever attackers may be competent enough to find flaws even in a fairly robust secured environment, and so a holistic security strategy is advised.
